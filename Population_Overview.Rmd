# Step 01 - Read Data & Load packages

The following dataset was downloaded from the **Texas Department of State Health Services**
on `2016-02-05`. I've made the data available on a [Google Sheet](), as a [RDS file](),
and as a [CSV file](). I'll be working off of the RDS file, because I've done some preliminary
data wrangling in R (see the `wrangle.R` script on Github).

```{r}
Population <- readRDS("Data/Population-full.RDS")

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
